I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Earth Science Education](https://earth.pusan.ac.kr/earthEng/index...do) at [Pusan National University (PNU)](https://www.pusan.ac.kr/eng/Main.do).

As a theoretical astrophysicist/cosmologist, my research interest lies in uncovering new physics through the Large-Scale Structure (LSS) of the Universe. My primary research explores the fundamental parity symmetry of the early Universe using novel LSS probes. Beyond symmetry, I develop methods to investigate the nature of cosmic initial conditions and dark matter/energy and provide rigorous tests for theories of gravity on cosmological scales.

Before joining PNU, I was a Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellow at the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) in Taiwan and a Research Fellow at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS). I earned my Ph.D. in Astronomy from Seoul National University, where I also completed my undergraduate studies in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, before transitioning into Astrophysics/Cosmology.
