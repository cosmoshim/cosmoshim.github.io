I am leading the Cosmology Group at PNU. I am interested in using the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe to uncover new physics in cosmology.
More specfically, my research program focuses on testing the parity symmetry of the Universe through novel LSS probes.
I have made a key contribution to this field by developing a novel method to generate parity-violating initial conditions and demonstrating their observable imprints in the LSS.
Leveraging these achievements, we will pioneer new LSS probes of cosmic parity symmetry and take the lead in placing direct observational constraints on the fundamental symmetry of the Universe.
